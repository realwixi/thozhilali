"At Tozhilali, we're a team of enthusiastic third-year Computer Science Engineering students from Aalim Muhammed Salegh College of Engineering.
Our journey began with a simple yet profound idea – bridging the gap between clients and workers in need of household services. 
Recognizing the need for an organized platform, we're developing a website and app to streamline the process.
Our platform empowers clients to easily connect with skilled workers through a user-friendly interface. 
Currently, we're offering services through a basic form registration system while our dedicated team works diligently on crafting a seamless app and website experience.
What sets us apart is our inclusive approach. We believe in providing opportunities not only for clients but also for students with expertise in plumbing and gardening.
By offering part-time employment opportunities, we aim to help students meet their daily expenses while enhancing their skills.
Furthermore, our initiative aligns with the educational curriculum set by Anna University regulations. 
We recognize the importance of practical knowledge, and our platform serves as a practical outlet for students to apply their learning in real-world scenarios.
At Tolilali, we're not just building a platform – we're building a community where clients find reliable services and students find meaningful employment opportunities. 
Join us on this journey of empowerment and convenience."
